## ‚≠ê About 
* Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton that follows a set of rules to determine the state of cells on a two-dimensional grid.

  Rules:
  1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, which is caused by under population. 

  2. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overcrowding. 

  3. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation. 

  4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.

  5. If a dead cell has exactly three live neighbors, it comes to

  6. If a live cell has less than two live neighbors, it dies

  7. If a live cell has more than three live neighbors, it dies

  8. If a live cell has two or three live neighbors, it continues living. life - Therefore by repeating the cycle over and over, these simple rules create interesting, often unpredictable patterns.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
